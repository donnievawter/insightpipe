> üß† LLM-powered image classification ‚Äî offline, modular, and camera-agnostic

**InsightPipe** decouples image analysis from camera infrastructure, letting you classify, tag, and broadcast image events from any source using flexible LLM inference. It‚Äôs designed for post-processing output from tools like Frigate, but doesn‚Äôt rely on their internal models or formats.

---

## üîí Local Model Support

### üß† Private LLM Inference (No Cloud Required)

InsightPipe connects to local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), giving you full control over:

- ‚úÖ What model is used  
- ‚úÖ What prompt is passed  
- ‚úÖ Where results are stored or sent

This allows you to run fully offline pipelines‚Äîno external API calls, no image uploads, no cloud dependencies.

Models are served locally using `ollama run`, and you can easily swap between different models like:

```
ollama run gemma ollama run openhermes
```

If your workflow demands **zero cloud contact**, InsightPipe is built for you.

## üîß Key Features

- Prompt-driven detection using local LLMs
- Modular pipeline for scan ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí tag ‚Üí publish
- Supports reprocessing with multiple models and prompts
- Metadata tagging (IPTC/XMP) for tools like Adobe Bridge, Photoshop, Immich
- MQTT broadcasting for downstream event integration
- Configurable output directories and file handling (move/copy)

## üìê Architecture Overview

![InsightPipe Architecture](assets/arch.jpg)


---

## üöÄ Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/donnievawter/insightpipe cd insightpipe python3 -m venv venv-insight source venv-insight/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update `config.yaml` and `.env` with your preferred model, prompt, watch directory, and output settings.

---

## üõ† Configuration

`config.yaml`
```
watch_dir: /Volumes/wildlife 
model_name: gemma-3b
prompt: Describe people, animals or vehicles in this image...
output_dir: /Volumes/processed 
output_mode: copy 
ollama_url: http://localhost:11434
poll_interval: 3 
stabilization_interval: 2
```
`.env`
```
MQTT_HOST=localhost
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USER=username
MQTT_PASSWORD=passwor
MQTT_TOPIC=wildlife/insightpipe

```
---
## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Ollama with a vision-capable model (e.g., `llava`)
- ExifTool installed

---

## üå± Philosophy

InsightPipe was designed to remain general. It doesn‚Äôt presume what image came from which source, doesn‚Äôt embed camera logic, and doesn‚Äôt enforce classifier formats. This lets you extend it across:

- Wildlife tracking  
- Security camera systems  
- Social media event prepping  
- Batch inference for archival images

Think of it not as a plugin, but a flexible bridge from perception to insight.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Semantic Keywording Mode

Starting in `v1.3`, InsightPipe supports **prompt-driven keyword extraction**, making it even easier for non-coders to auto-tag images for search, cataloging, or archival use.

### üîÄ Configuration

Enable keyword mode by setting these fields in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
keyword: true
keywordPrompt: What keywords would best describe this image? Provide a comma-separated list of tags...
```

- When `keyword: true`, the app uses `keywordPrompt` instead of the main `prompt`
- Output is written to `IPTC:Keywords`, not to `Description`
- No prompt metadata is stored, keeping tags clean and lean

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Works with **local LLMs via Ollama**
- Generates highly relevant, searchable tags
- Ideal for workflows in **photo archiving, semantic search, or gallery prep**
- No coding required‚Äîjust drop images into the watch folder and go

---

---

---

## üß† Command-Line Execution

Starting in `v1.4`, InsightPipe supports runtime overrides via command-line flags. This enables both developer orchestration and simplified one-shot runs for non-technical users.

### üîÑ Default Behavior

InsightPipe defaults to **batch mode**: it scans the contents of `watch_dir` once, applies tagging and keywording, then exits.

To enable continuous watching, use the `--watch` flag or set `"watch": true` in your `config.yaml`.

---

### üîß Available Flags

```bash
python insightpipe.py [flags]

--config            Path to YAML config file (default: config.yaml)
--watch_dir         Folder to monitor for new images
--model_name        Ollama model to use for inference
--prompt            Prompt for description mode
--keywords          Enable keywording mode
--no_keywords       Disable keywording mode
--keyword_prompt    Prompt for keyword generation
--output_dir        Folder to save processed images
--output_mode       File handling method: copy or move
--dry_run           Show final config after overrides and exit
--watch             Enable continuous mode (folder is polled indefinitely)
--batch             Explicitly trigger batch mode (run once and exit)
```

### üîÑ Execution Modes

| Mode        | Behavior                                                              | Trigger                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Batch       | Processes `watch_dir` once, tags images, then exits                   | Default, or `--batch`       |
| Watch       | Continuously polls folder and tags new images                         | `--watch` or config setting |
| Dry Run     | Shows final config after overrides; no tagging or file changes        | `--dry_run`                 |

---

### üß™ Example Usage

**Single-pass batch tagging:**

```bash
python insightpipe.py \
  --watch_dir ./images \
  --output_dir ./tagged \
  --model_name gemma:3b \
  --keywords \
  --keyword_prompt "List descriptive tags for archival purposes"
```

**Inspect configuration before execution:**

```bash
python insightpipe.py --config testing.yaml --dry_run
```

**Enable real-time watching (dev use):**

```bash
python insightpipe.py --watch
```

---

### ‚úÖ Notes

- Flags override settings from `config.yaml`
- Keywording must be toggled explicitly via `--keywords` or `--no_keywords`
- `--dry_run` is great for verification before batch jobs
- Non-dev users can skip the CLI entirely and rely on config-driven execution

---

Keep InsightPipe lean, sharp, and composable‚Äîjust like it was designed.

### üîÑ Example Usage

```bash
python insightpipe.py \
  --watch_dir /Volumes/wildlife \
  --output_dir /Volumes/tagged \
  --model_name gemma:3b \
  --keyword \
  --keyword_prompt "Provide a comma-separated list of animal descriptors"
```

Use `--dry_run` to inspect final configuration before execution:

```bash
python insightpipe.py --config custom.yaml --dry_run
```
