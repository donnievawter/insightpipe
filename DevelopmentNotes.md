# ðŸš§ InsightPipe â€” Development Notes

## Ideas for Future Expansion

- Docker container for non-dev usage
- Dry-run simulation with image previews
- UI layer (local gallery or prompt editor)
- Remote Ollama support for lightweight clients
- Config templating with domain presets (e.g. wildlife, abstracts)

## Guiding Principles

- Minimal setup friction
- Modular structure
- Semantic clarity in outputs
- Respect for resource constraints
- Built for deliberate, thoughtful useâ€”not speed
